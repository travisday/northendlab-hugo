Our world is filled with incredible molecules and through science and chemistry we have been able to synthesize new molecules. The term drug refers to any molecule that causes a change in the physiology or psychology of a living thing when entered into the body. Throughout history society has dichotomized drugs as good or bad. The goal of this series is not to pick a side for each drug but instead provide information about how the drugs work and research on their uses.

A note on drug use.  
When I say drug use I do not mean only the use of illicit drugs like heroin or methanphedamine. I mean the use of any kind of drug whether it be leagal or illiegal i.e. caffeine, nicotine, THC, LSD, MDMA, alchohol, etc. Drugs are tools and just like tools if you use them incorrectly the results can seriously do you harm or even be fatal. Before experimenting with any drug no matter the reason (enhanced productivity, euphoria...etc) it is always a good idea to speak with a doctor. It is also a good idea to take into consideration the legality of drugs you are taking or thinking of taking in your area. That being said, when used correctly drugs can be an incredible asset.
